To run the game, execute the "Main.py" file in the "Code" folder.
Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
Install Pygame by typing "pip install pygame" in CMD/Terminal.

You can modify the images and code, but you need to know what you're doing!

I included images to help you with the process. Download python here https://www.python.org/downloads/

Enjoy! :D
